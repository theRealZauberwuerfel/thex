-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Maybe some of us know the japanese board game Go.
                     But there's a similar game from the 40s.
                     It's called `Hex` and its creators are the Danish
                     mathematician Piet Hein and also the famous John Nash.
                     For Go a GNU implementation to play on terminal exists.
                     So it would be useful to have something for Hex, too.
                     For that the Haskell ncurses binding is used.
